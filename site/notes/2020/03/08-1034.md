Wanted: something like [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/), but for iOS. [Bear](https://bear.app) is beautiful and I love it, but I want my notes *on disk* because then I can do anything with them from anywhere—not just what one app can come up from. (And yes, a document object model like people dreamt of in the 90s would also solve this well, but for today I’ll take what I can get.)

And yes, this *is* what I’m working on with [rewrite](https://rewrite.software).
