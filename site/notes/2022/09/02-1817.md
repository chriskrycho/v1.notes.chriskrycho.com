While I appreciate *that* [Obsidian][o] has a mobile app… I think I’m going to end up using a mix of [iA Writer][ia] and [1Writer][1w]—both of which support basic wiki-linking—as my primary iOS notes interface.

[o]: https://obsidian.md
[ia]: https://ia.net/writer
[1w]: https://1writerapp.com

(The fact that I *can* do this is, of course, a big upside to notes which are just files on disk!)
