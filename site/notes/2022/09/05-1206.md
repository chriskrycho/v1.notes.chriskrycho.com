In case it’s interesting or helpful to anyone, I just created [a template repo on GitHub][repo] with my current [Obsidian][o] configuration, which includes my full config other than the bits which are specific my own notes layout. Let me know if it’s useful to you!

[repo]: https://github.com/chriskrycho/obsidian-template
