A macOS pro tip: **System Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Pointer Control** > **Trackpad Options** > **Use trackpad for dragging** to on, with **Dragging style** set to **Three Finger Drag**. All the benefits of tap-to-click for dragging only, but unambiguous.

Ages ago, this was a top-level preference, and in my opinion it still should be!
