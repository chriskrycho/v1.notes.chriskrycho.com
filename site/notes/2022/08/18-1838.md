So my day today has included running TypeScript [with `traceResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#traceResolution) and adding a `resolutions` key to [Glint](https://github.com/typed-ember/glint) because TS was mis-resolving a transitive version of a package and so [module merging](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) wasn't working correctly.

How's *your* day going, developers? ðŸ˜‚
