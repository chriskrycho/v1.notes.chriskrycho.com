As is now apparently obligatory for folks in my general circles, I have started [<cite>Seeing Like a State</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780300246759). It is pretty good so far! Also made me want to go back and get through the rest of Eisensteinâ€™s [<cite>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780521299558).
