My friend [Jake Meador][jake]’s new book [<cite>What are Christians For?</cite>][book] is out today, and you should get it and read it. You might not agree with everything Jake says—I’m guaranteed not to, based on our conversations over the last couple years!—but you’ll surely profit from the reading.
