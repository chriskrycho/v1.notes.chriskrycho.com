Just came across Isobel Waller-Bridgeâ€™s music for the first time and: ðŸ¤© (but for my ears, I guess? Whereâ€™s my star-ears emoji?) Her standalone works like [Music for Strings](https://songwhip.com/isobelwallerbridge/music-for-strings "") are great, as is her scoring: her (collaboration with David Schweitzer) [Emma](https://songwhip.com/isobelwallerbridge/emma "") is just delightful.
