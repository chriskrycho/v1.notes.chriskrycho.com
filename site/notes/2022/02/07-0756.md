Wanted: for all papers in all journals in all fields to be available as well-designed HTML and EPUB as well as PDF. Honestly, itâ€™s infuriating (and thoroughly inaccessible!) that the standard is a fixed document format design.

\[Aside: asking for format choices, not zero cost. Open access is a distinct good, *also* worth fighting for, particularly for its impact on the possibility of independent scholarship.]
