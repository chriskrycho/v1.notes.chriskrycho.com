Just published: [tracked-queue v2.0.0](https://github.com/linkedin/tracked-queue/releases/tag/v2.0.0)â€”no changes to the API, just an update to drop Node 12, add support for Ember.js v4, and set minimum supported TypeScript version (<abbr>MSTSV</abbr>!) to 4.4, and make some internal improvements.
