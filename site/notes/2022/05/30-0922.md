ðŸŽ¼ Other composers out there: how do you organize your projects? Historically, Iâ€™ve organized by year, since nothing I did ever crossed that boundary. Nowâ€¦ *multiple* projects Iâ€™m working on are crossing year boundaries.

(For software, I just have one top-level directory for my workâ€¦ but I also donâ€™t keep everything on my machine all the timeâ€”I have GitHub etc. for off-machine homes for it. If I did that for my music, I would have close to 100 folders, which is just a pain to navigate.)
