Just published a minor release of [tracked-queue](https://github.com/linkedin/tracked-queue)—a high-performance double-ended queue for [Ember](https://emberjs.com) apps and addons I built for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) last year—which added support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) 4.4–4.6.

Inbound tomorrow: a major release which supports Ember v4!
