Since [Jake let the cat out of the bag](https://twitter.com/mereorthodoxy/status/1529859400650964993), I can now say: I’m in the (upcoming) third print issue of <cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite> with a 2-book review: Richard Sennett’s [<cite>The Corrosion of Character</cite>][cc] and Warzel and Petersen’s [<cite>Out of Office</cite>][ooo]. I’m proud of it, and will of course share when it’s published.
