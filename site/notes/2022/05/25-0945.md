Published two versions of [True Myth](https://github.com/true-myth/true-myth/) this morning!

- [v5.4.0][5.4] adds support for the latest Node and TS versions so you can tackle those upgrades separately from:
- [v6.0.0][6.0] *requires* Node 14+ and TS 4.7+ to support `exports`, drops deprecated code, and improves tree-shake-ability

[5.4]: https://github.com/true-myth/true-myth/releases/tag/v5.4.0
[6.0]: https://github.com/true-myth/true-myth/releases/tag/v6.0.0
